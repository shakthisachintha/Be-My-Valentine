# 💝 Will You Be My Valentine?

A fun, interactive Valentine's Day web app that makes it impossible to say "No"! The "No" button playfully dodges the cursor with a beautiful star trail effect, and if you try too hard... well, you'll meet the consequences. 😾

## ✨ Features

- **Elusive "No" Button**: The "No" button runs away from your cursor, making it nearly impossible to click
- **Star Trail Animation**: Beautiful animated stars follow the button as it moves across the screen
- **Warning System**: After 6 attempts to click "No", a dramatic warning appears with a cat holding a gun
- **Smooth Animations**: Built with Motion for fluid, spring-based animations
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on all screen sizes
- **Modern Stack**: React 19, TypeScript, Vite 7, Tailwind CSS 4
